### 1. Setup

#### Include the ApplozicSwift SDK for iOS in an Existing Application

The iOS ApplozicSwift SDK can be installed using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager, as you prefer.

### Install ApplozicSwift with CocoaPods

ApplozicSwift is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the root directory of your Project (the directory where your *.xcodeproj file is)
3. Run command

```bash
pod init
```

Again go to your Project's root directory, click on the "Podfile" to open.
Copy-paste the following code in the file and Save

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs'
use_frameworks!  # Required to add 
platform :ios, '10.0'

target 'TARGET_NAME' do
pod 'ApplozicSwift'  # Required to add 
end
```

4. Go to your project directory where Podfile there run `pod install` or `pod update` from terminal to refresh the CocoaPods dependencies.

5. Open your project newly generated `*.xcworkspace` or existing and build your project.

### Install ApplozicSwift with Swift Package Manager  

Install via Xcode 

1. In Xcode, install the ApplozicSwift SDK by navigating to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependencyâ€¦

2. In the prompt that appears, select the ApplozicSwift GitHub repository:

```swift

### Add Permissions

App Store requires any app which accesses camera, contacts, gallery, location, a microphone to add the description of why does your app needs to access these features.

In the `Info.plist` file of your project. Please add the following permissions

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow Camera</string>
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow Contacts</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow location sharing!!</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow MicroPhone</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow Photos</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow write access</string>
```

### Importing Methods for Authentication

The method file that we need here is `ALChatManager` files.

1. Download the `ALChatManager.swift` [here](Demo/ApplozicSwiftDemo/ALChatManager.swift)
2. Add the downloaded `ALChatManager.swift` in your project by clicking on Add Files option on any folder
3. Open `ALChatManager.swift` file in your Xcode and Replace "applozic-sample-app" with your App ID from [here](https://console.applozic.com/settings)


### 2. Register/Login the User

The authentication process allows you to create users or log them into chat whenever necessary. 
This is usually done along with the login or registration of users within your app i.e. within the login or register buttons in your app.

```swift
let alUser : ALUser =  ALUser()
alUser.applicationId = <PASS_YOUR_APP_ID_HERE>
alUser.userId = "demoUserId" // NOTE : +,*,? and space are not allowed chars in userId.
alUser.email = "github@applozic.com"
alUser.imageLink = ""  // User's profile image link.
alUser.displayName = "DemoUserName"  // User's Display Name
alUser.password = "testpassword" //User password

//Saving these details
ALUserDefaultsHandler.setUserAuthenticationTypeId(Int16(APPLOZIC.rawValue))

//Registering or Login in the User
ALChatManager.shared.connectUser(alUser, completion: { response, error in
    if error != nil {
        print("Error while logging \(String(describing: error))")
    } else {
        print("Successfull login")
    }
})
```
**Note:** Another thing you must understand is, in case of ApplozicSwift SDK both Registering a new user and loging in an existing user has the same process and code.
### 4. Opening a conversation and sending the first message

Implement the following code at the event or Button action designated for opening a one to one conversation for sending a message Pass the ``RECIPIENT-USERID``

```swift
ALChatManager.shared.launchChatWith(contactId: <RECIPIENT-USERID>, from: self)
```

### 5. Launch chat list

Implement the following code at the event or Button action designated for showing chat list screen.

```swift
ALChatManager.shared.launchChatList(from: self)
```

### 5. Logout user

On logout of your app you need to logout the applozic user as well use the below method to logout the user:  

```swift
ALChatManager.shared.logoutUser { _ in
   print("Logout successfully")
}
```
