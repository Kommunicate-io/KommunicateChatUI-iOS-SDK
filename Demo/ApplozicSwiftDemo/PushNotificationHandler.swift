/* Handle following cases for notification ::
 /* 1. Detailed chat screen is on top.
  And chat was happening for the user for whom notification came.
  So, Don't show notification.
  */
 /* 2. Detailed chat screen is on top.
  And chat was happening with different user/group.
  Here, refresh chat screen to show chat with the user for whom notification came.
  */
 /* 3. Chat list screen is on top.
  Open detailed chat with the user/group.
  */
 /* 4. Any other screen is on top.
  Push chat list screen and then push detailed chat.
  Or you can directly push chat list while setting contactId/groupId
  and it will open detailed chat automatically.
